0 Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 Tat/co-activator acetyltransferase interactions inhibit p53Lys-320 acetylation and p53-responsive transcription.
3 Because Tat has been shown to interact with histone acetyltransferase domains of p300/cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein and p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor, we have investigated whether Tat might alter p53 acetylation and tumor suppressor-responsive transcription.
5 Further, p53 trans-activation of the 14-3-3varsigma promoter was markedly repressed by Tat-histone acetyltransferase interactions, and p53 acetylation by p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor on residue Lys(320) was diminished as a result of Tat-histone acetyltransferase binding in vivo and in vitro.
6 Tat also inhibited p53 acetylation by p300 in a dosage-dependent manner in vitro.
7 Finally, HIV-1-infected Molt-4 cells displayed reduced p53 acetylation on lysines 320 and 373 in response to UV irradiation.
